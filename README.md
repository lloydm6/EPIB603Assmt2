finished 2nd question

3rd commit after finding error on q and finishing q3

4th commit, finished q4, though the 2x2 vs 1x2 is weird

5th commit, finished q5 for the most part, though the last part of the q asks for independent variables and i just grabbed all but age. 

6th commit, finally saving rmd with this...so hopefully I can see 2 verions in github, did the last question, which was just changing generic answers to my code. 

7th, a quick small change, taking out the "install.packages()" in two places
